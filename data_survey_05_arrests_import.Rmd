# ⭐️Overview

This file is used to import the Link2Care arrest data and do some initial data cleaning. 

**NOTE on data sources:**

The arrest data is securely transmitted by Dr. Gonzalez as an Excel file, which is stored on OneDrive in Participant Data > Arrest Data Requests.


# 📦Load packages

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(readxl, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(readr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
```


# 📥Import data 

* Had to remove password from Excel sheet before import. File -> Passwords... -> Delete password.   

```{r}
path <- "data/arrest_data/current_arrest_data.xlsx"
```

Check the most recent file modification dates on OneDrive and print for user when this file is being sourced.

```


# 🗑Clean up

Don't use `rm(list = ls())` because is causes R to drop the helper functions in data_survey_21_update_all_data.Rmd

```{r}
rm(list = ls()[ls() != "source_rmd"])
```
