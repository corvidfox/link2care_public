# ‚≠êÔ∏èOverview

2022-08-06: Received abstract proposal from Michael. The proposal is in: L2C Teams/Abstract Projects/Audrey Montgomery/Montgomery_AbstractAndManuscript_Proposal_Form.docx

The purpose of the current study is to compare psychiatric medications adherence across diagnoses and to explore how mobile health apps can be used to increase medication adherence. 

## Questions

1. What to do about insurance some people have zeros all the way across -- Even for None? Right now, they are missing.

#### Any prescription for the disorders listed above

For each of the questions about prescriptions for specific medications (srh_24a:srh_24e), did the participant respond "yes" to any?
* Yes to any one of them should be a "Yes"
* No to all of them should be a "No"
* NA for any of them should be an NA
* Yes to srh_24f (prescribed none) and a Yes to any of srh_24a:srh_24e should be an NA. Unreliable.

    )
  )

#### Missed taking a any meds yesterday

Among those who were given a prescription for a medication (srh_24a:srh_24e), how many reported that they did not take it yesterday (srh_25, 27, 29, 31, 33)?

So, 
- For each medication question, did they say yes? 
- If they said yes, did they respond to the "did you take it yesterday" question? 
- Among those who responded to the "did you take it yesterday" question, for every condition that they responded "yes" to having prescription for, how many said yes and no to missing yesterday?

**Data check:** How many of those who reported a prescription have a missing value for did you take it yesterday? None as of 2022-09-06.

```{r}
l2c_v1_analysis %>% 
  # Line up prescription next to take or not for testing
  select(
    srh_24f, # None
    srh_24a, srh_25, # Depression prescription have/take
    srh_24b, srh_27, # Schizophrenia prescription have/take
    srh_24c, srh_29, # Bipolar prescription have/take
    srh_24d, srh_31, # Anxiety prescription have/take
    srh_24e, srh_33  # PTSD prescription have/take
  ) %>% 
  # Create new vars for missing take prescription response
  # If you said "yes" to having a prescription (e.g., srh_24a), did you give a 
  # response to taking it yesterday (e.g., srh_25)?
  mutate(
    dep_yest_miss = srh_24a == 1 & is.na(srh_25),
    sch_yest_miss = srh_24b == 1 & is.na(srh_27),
    bip_yest_miss = srh_24c == 1 & is.na(srh_29),
    anx_yest_miss = srh_24d == 1 & is.na(srh_31),
    pts_yest_miss = srh_24e == 1 & is.na(srh_33)
  ) %>%
  summarise(across(dep_yest_miss:pts_yest_miss, sum, na.rm = TRUE))
```

From above, we know that everyone who reported having a prescription (srh_24a:srh_24e) has a non-missing value for the follow-up "did you take it yesterday" question. Next, let's determine:

1. How many people who were prescribed each type of medication forgot to take it yesterday?
2. How many people who were prescribed any type of medication forgot to take it yesterday?

# üìàAnalysis

The purpose of the current study is to compare psychiatric medications adherence across diagnoses and to explore how mobile health apps can be used to increase medication adherence.

### Make flextable

Improve row headers

Finish flextable formatting

Add flextable to Word document

### Combined Flextable

Bind cat and cont by group

```{r}
table_02 <- left_join(
  unadj_logistic,
  adj_logistic,
  by = "term",
  suffix = c("_unadj", "_adj")
)
```

Make flextable

```{r}
table_02_ft <- flextable(table_02)
```

Format flextable

```{r}
table_02_ft <- table_02_ft %>%
  # Change column widths. figure out through trial and error
  width(width = c(3.25, 1.62, 1.62)) %>%
  # Center text in all but the first column

    stats_adj = "Adjusted\nOR (95% CI)"
  ) %>%
  # Bold column headers
  bold(part = "header")

Improve row headers

```{r}

  compose(i = 2, j = 1, as_paragraph(as_chunk("Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective disorder"))) %>%

  compose(i = 5, j = 1, as_paragraph(as_chunk("Anxiety Disorder besides PTSD")))
```

Finish flextable formatting

```{r}

  # Change font to TNR 11
  font(fontname = "Arial", part = "all") %>%

Add flextable to Word document

## Table 3

Reasons for not taking medication on the previous day by medication type.

For column headers, who many people reported not taking each medication on the previous day?

```{r}
l2c_v1_analysis %>% 
  summarise(
    across(
      prescribed_dep_missed:prescribed_ptsd_missed,
      sum, na.rm = TRUE
    )
  )
```

```{r}
# One var
l2c_v1_analysis %>% 
  # Remove missing
  filter(!is.na(!! sym("dep_side_effects"))) %>% 
  freq_table(!! sym("dep_side_effects")) %>% 
  freq_format("n (percent%)", digits = 0)
```

```{r}
# Loop over all reasons
all_reasons <- map_df(
  new_names,
  ~ l2c_v1_analysis %>% 
    # Remove missing
    filter(!is.na(!! sym(.x))) %>% 
    freq_table(!! sym(.x)) %>% 
    freq_format("n (percent%)", digits = 0) %>% 
    # Keep "Yes" only
    filter(cat == "Yes") %>% 
    # Keep var and formatted stats only
    select(var, formatted_stats)
)
```

I checked and the n_total output by the code above matches the total number of people who reported missing a medication a couple of code chunks above. 

Now let's reshape the data to make it easier to fit into the word table

```{r}
all_reasons <- all_reasons %>% 
  # Need to separate the medication type and the reason before pivoting.
  separate(var, c("med", "reason"), extra = "merge") %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = med,
    values_from = formatted_stats
  )
```

Because I'm running low on time and I already have a table outline made in the Word template document, I'm just going to output this table to a temporary Word doc. Then, I will copy and paste the values into the template.

```{r}
all_reasons_ft <- flextable(all_reasons) %>% autofit()
doc <- read_docx() %>% body_add_flextable(all_reasons_ft)
print(doc, "/Users/bradcannell/Desktop/temp.docx")
```

Add flextable to Word document

```{r}
doc <- read_docx("../../Abstract Projects/Audrey Montgomery/Montgomery_AbstractAndManuscript_Proposal_Form.docx") %>% 
  body_replace_flextable_at_bkm("table_01", table_01_ft) %>% 
  # Overall n in title
  body_replace_text_at_bkm("n_overall", as.character(sum(table(l2c_v1_analysis_complete$prescribed_missed_any)))) %>% 
  body_replace_flextable_at_bkm("table_02", table_02_ft)
```

```{r}
