title: "Import and manage Link2Care Survey Data"
date: "2020-12-23"
---

This file is used to import the Link2Care follow-up visit survey data and do some initial data cleaning (e.g., create calculated variables). 

**NOTE on data sources:**
* Initially, I tried to separate importing the data from QDS, REDCap, and the Excel master log. However, that doesn't work very well because the three different data sources are so intertwined. For example, some people have visit 1 in QDS and visit 2 in REDCap. Further, the QDS data often doesn't contain every participant's group membership information (i.e., which study arm the participants were randomly assigned to). Therefore, we kind of need to import all three data sources and combine them to create complete follow-up visit survey data.

* The QDS data is exported from QDS in SPSS data format. The data has to be exported by visit (i.e., v1, v2, ... v5). The SPSS data is then added to the UTHealth servers.

* Some of the v3-v5 visits are also done using REDCap. That data is exported from REDCap and added to the UTHealth servers. Because I'm only creating tables of statistics from baseline visit right now, I'm not currently importing and cleaning the REDCap data. Correction, I still need the REDCap data for group membership at v3-v5.

**NOTE on Kiteworks:**
Currently, I'm importing all of this data from the UTHealth server. The data should also be available on Kiteworks if you are unable to connect to the server for some reason.

# 📥Import data 

## Import QDS data

```{r}
walk(
  .x = c(1:5),
  .f = function(x) {
    new_nm <- paste0("v", x)
    sav_nm <- paste0("Visit_", x, "_Data.SAV")
    path <- paste0(qds_spss_path, sav_nm)
    assign(new_nm, read_sav(path), envir = .GlobalEnv)
  }
)
```

```{r}
walk(
  .x = c(1:5),
  .f = function(x) {
    df_nm <- paste0("v", x)
    df <- get(df_nm, envir = .GlobalEnv)
    # Print a message for when this file is being sourced
    cat(
      paste0(Sys.Date(), ":"),
      df_nm, "imported with", nrow(df), "rows and", ncol(df), "columns.\n"
    )
  }
)

# These are expected to change over time as we add more people to the study.
# However, drastic changes from month-to-month, or even quarter-to-quarter,
# should initiate an investigation into what's going on.
# 2021-01-28: v1 imported with 263 rows and 803 columns.
# 2021-01-28: v2 imported with 246 rows and 199 columns.
# 2021-01-28: v3 imported with 178 rows and 526 columns.
# 2021-01-28: v4 imported with 136 rows and 582 columns.
# 2021-01-28: v5 imported with 129 rows and 630 columns.
```

**NOTE on converting to lowercase:** Don't convert to lowercase in this script. Leaving the column names in uppercase makes it easier to use the Word code book and the SPSS code that Michael wrote. The variables that I'm creating and using for analysis are all given lower, snake case names anyway. It should be the case that any variable that isn't in lowercase is a variable I'm not using in analysis.

## Import REDCap data

In some cases, we will need to supplement the QDS data with data that is captured in REDCap.

For now, keep only the id and group from REDCap. We may need other information in the future.

```{r message=FALSE}
redcap <- read_sav(redcap_spss_path) %>% 
  select(id = record_id, visit, group) %>% 
  arrange(id, visit)

# Print a message for when this file is being sourced
cat(
  paste0(Sys.Date(), ":"),
  "REDCap imported with", nrow(redcap), "rows and", ncol(redcap), "columns.\n"
)

# 2021-01-28: REDCap imported with 12 rows and 3 columns.
```

## Import Excel master log

This is primarily to supplement the group membership data (i.e., L2C, UCM, UCM+SP). Group membership is randomly assigned at visit 2, but it is not recorded in QDS until visit 3 and beyond. Therefore, if we only rely on QDS data, it appears as though many participants haven't been randomized to a group even though they have. The study staff manually tracks group assignment in the Excel Master Log. We can use that data to cross-check and impute group membership. It is not ideal, but it seems to be the best option we have.

For now, keep only the id and group from the master log. We may need other information in the future.

```{r}
master_log <- read_excel(
  master_log_path, 
  sheet = "Screened In",
  col_names = c("id", "group"),
  col_types = c("text", rep("skip", 22), "text", rep("skip", 31)),
  skip = 1
) %>% 
  # Coerce group to numeric so that it can be combined with the QDS data.
  mutate(
    group = case_when(
      group == "UCM"    ~ 1,
      group == "UCM+SP" ~ 2,
      group == "L2C"    ~ 3
    )
  )

# Print a message for when this file is being sourced
cat(
  paste0(Sys.Date(), ":"),
  "Master log imported with", nrow(master_log), "rows and", ncol(master_log),
  "columns.\n"
)

# 2021-01-28: Master log imported with 263 rows and 2 columns.
```

```{r}
rm(master_log_path, qds_spss_path, redcap_spss_path)
```


# 🚧Data management 

**NOTE on converting to lowercase:** 
* Don't convert all variable names to lowercase. Leaving the column names in uppercase makes it easier to use the Word code book and the SPSS code that Michael wrote. 
* Make all calculated/created variables that will be used for analysis using lowercase names.

## Create a single group variable

Instead of group_v3, group_v4, and group_v5 (which can be conflicting). 

First, gather all of the group information from the v3-v5 QDS data. We aren't using v1 and v2 because group membership isn't in the QDS survey at v1 and v2 (which is part of the problem).

```{r}
# Stack (row bind) id and group from each of v3, v4, and v5
group_qds_long <- map_dfr(
  .x = paste0("v", 3:5),
  .f = function(x) {
    get(x, envir = .GlobalEnv) %>% 
      select(id = SUBJECT, group = GROUP) %>% 
      mutate(visit = str_extract(x, "\\d") %>% as.integer())
  }) %>% 
  arrange(id, visit) %>% 
  
  # Fill values of group down within id
  group_by(id) %>% 
  fill(group, .direction = "downup") %>% 
  
  # Now check for multiple group values within id
  mutate(mult_group = unique(group) %>% length() > 1) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

Manually review id's with multiple group values

```{r}
group_qds_long %>% 
  filter(mult_group == TRUE)
```

**NOTE on multiple groups per id:**
Manually fix group value and let James know that they need to be fixed in QDS. After they are fixed, they will no longer show up here. Still, use these notes to keep a record.

2021-01-11, From James: 
* P2023: V5 grouping entered incorrectly on QDS. Entered 'L2C' (3) instead of 'UCM+SP' (2) 
* P2057: V3 grouping entered incorrectly on QDS. Entered 'UCM' (1) instead of 'L2C' (3) 
* P2136: V5 grouping entered incorrectly on QDS. Entered 'UCM+SP' (2) instead of 'L2C' (3)

```{r}
# Do it this way instead of with dplyr, so you don't have to mess with class
group_qds_long[group_qds_long$id == 2023, "group"] <- 2
group_qds_long[group_qds_long$id == 2057, "group"] <- 3
group_qds_long[group_qds_long$id == 2136, "group"] <- 3
```

Do one more check for multiple group values

Wrapping this data check in a stop function for when this file is sourced.

```{r}
# For data checks
check_qds_group_values <- group_qds_long %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  # Now check for multiple group values within id
  filter(unique(group) %>% length() > 1)

if (nrow(check_qds_group_values) > 0) {
  stop("At least one participant in the QDS data is assigned to more than one group. Please investigate further in data_survey_01_import.Rmd.")
}
```

Now, the value of group is the same in every row for each id. So, just use the first row for each id.

```{r}
group_qds <- group_qds_long %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  filter(row_number() == 1) %>% 
  select(id, group) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

### REDCap: Check for differences in the REDCap data

Are the group values consistent in REDCap?

Wrapping this data check in a stop function for when this file is sourced.

```{r}
# For data checks
check_redcap_group_values <- redcap %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  filter(unique(group) %>% length() > 1)

if (nrow(check_redcap_group_values) > 0) {
  stop("At least one participant in the REDCap data is assigned to more than one group. Please investigate further in data_survey_01_import.Rmd.")
}
```

Yes, so now we don't need to worry about visit number. We can just keep one row per id, and check to make sure that group in REDCap matches group in the QDS data.

```{r}
redcap <- redcap %>% 
  distinct(id, group)
```

Manually check for differences between group assignment in QDS and REDCap.

```{r}
redcap %>% 
  left_join(
    group_qds %>% 
      select(id, group) %>% 
      # To prevent type mismatch error:
      mutate(id = as.character(id)),
    by = "id",
    suffix = c("_rc", "_qds")
  ) %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  filter(length(unique(c_across(group_rc:group_qds))) > 1)
```

Manually fill in data values in the QDS data.

```{r}
# Do it this way instead of with dplyr, so you don't have to mess with class
group_qds <- group_qds %>% 
  add_row(id = 2252, group = 2) %>% 
  add_row(id = 2253, group = 3) %>%
  add_row(id = 2260, group = 2)
```

Wrapping this data check in a stop function for when this file is sourced.

```{r}
# For data checks
check_qds_redcap_group_diffs <- redcap %>% 
  left_join(
    group_qds %>% 
      select(id, group) %>% 
      # To prevent type mismatch error:
      mutate(id = as.character(id)),
    by = "id",
    suffix = c("_rc", "_qds")
  ) %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  filter(length(unique(c_across(group_rc:group_qds))) > 1)

if (nrow(check_qds_redcap_group_diffs) > 0) {
  stop("At least one participant is assigned to different groups in the QDS and REDCap data. Please investigate further in data_survey_01_import.Rmd.")
}
```

### Master log: Supplement with Excel master log data

Manually check for differences between group assignment in QDS and master log.

```{r}
check_qds_ml_group_diffs <- master_log %>%
  left_join(
    group_qds %>% 
      select(id, group) %>% 
      # To prevent type mismatch error:
      mutate(id = as.character(id)),
    by = "id",
    suffix = c("_ml", "_qds")
  ) %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  filter(length(unique(c_across(group_ml:group_qds))) > 1)
```

There are a bunch of id's with group membership data in master log, but not in QDS. Mostly, because these people haven't completed a v3 in QDS yet. We will go ahead and fill in the missing group data from the master log.

Below, we will formally check to see if there are any conflicting group values aside from group simply being missing in the QDS data. We will also wrap this data check in a stop function for when this file is sourced.

```{r}
# For data checks
check_qds_ml_group_diffs_not_na <- check_qds_ml_group_diffs %>% 
  filter(!is.na(group_qds))

if (nrow(check_qds_ml_group_diffs_not_na) > 0) {
  stop("At least one participant is assigned to different groups in the QDS and master log data. This not simply due to a missing group value in master log. Please investigate further in data_survey_01_import.Rmd.")
}
```

Now there are no "conflicts" between group in the QDS data and group in the master log. The differences were all simply due to the fact that there is no group membership information at all in QDS for these participants. Therefore, we can just go ahead and row bind. In the future, if there are conflicts between group_diffs\$group_diffs and group_diffs\$group_qds, we will need to manage them.

```{r}
group_qds <- group_qds %>% 
  bind_rows(
    check_qds_ml_group_diffs %>% 
      select(id, group = group_ml) %>% 
      # To prevent type mismatch error:
      mutate(id = as.numeric(id))
  ) %>% 
  arrange(id)
```

How many participants are assigned to a group?

```{r}
n_randomized <- group_qds %>% 
  filter(!is.na(group)) %>% 
  nrow()

# Print a message for when this file is being sourced
cat(
  paste0(Sys.Date(), ":"), n_randomized, 
  "participants have been randomized to a treatment group.\n"
)

# 2021-01-28: 244 participants have been randomized to a treatment group.
```

At this point, each person who was assigned to a group should have one, and only one, group value.

```{r}
rm(
  check_qds_group_values, check_qds_ml_group_diffs, 
  check_qds_ml_group_diffs_not_na, check_qds_redcap_group_diffs, 
  check_redcap_group_values, group_qds_long, master_log, redcap, n_randomized
)
```

## Fix variable suffix errors

Currently, there is a gender column in the v3, 4, and 5 data frames that doesn't have a \_v3, \_v4, and \_v5 suffix. This causes R to create gender.x, gender.y, etc. columns when we join the data frames below.

I noticed there are some other variables with the same issue. I'll go ahead and add \_vX to those as well.  

```{r}
walk(
  .x = c("GENDER", "GROUP"),
  .f = function(y) {
    walk(
      .x = c(1:5),
      .f = function(x) {
        df_nm <- paste0("v", x)
        df <- get(df_nm, envir = .GlobalEnv)
        new_nm <- paste0(y, "_V", x)
        names(df)[names(df) == y] <- new_nm
        assign(df_nm, df, envir = .GlobalEnv)
      }
    )
  }
)

# For testing
# sort(names(v4))
```

```{r}
# The suffixes for the HEIGHT and WEIGHT variables don't have a regular suffix pattern. We have to change them manually in each data set.
v1 <- v1 %>% rename(HEIGHT_V1 = HEIGHT, WEIGHT_V1 = WEIGHT)
v3 <- v3 %>% rename(HEIGHT_V3 = HEIGHT_3, WEIGHT_V3 = WEIGHT_3)
v4 <- v4 %>% rename(HEIGHT_V4 = HEIGHT, WEIGHT_V4 = WEIGHT_4)
v5 <- v5 %>% rename(WEIGHT_V5 = WEIGHT_5)
```

Fix visit 5 variable suffixes

It looks like there are 75 variables in the V5 QDS data that are incorrectly named. They include "V4" in their names instead of "V5", or the end with "_V4" instead of "_V5". The variables include BH10-BH18, DEM6-DEM14, PHQ1-PHQ15, and T36-T40.

Additionally, HS1-HS12 (Self rated health) have a _V1 suffix instead of a _V5 suffix.

2021-01-28: I don't actually see this problem anymore. Leaving the commented out code just in case we need it again in the future.

```{r}
# v5 <- rename_with(v5, ~ str_replace_all(.x, "V4", "V5"))
# v5 <- v5 %>% rename_with(
#   .fn   = ~ str_replace_all(.x, "V1", "V5"),
#   .cols = all_of(paste0("HS", 1:12, "_V1"))
# )

# For testing
# sort(names(v5))
```

## Join QDS data sets together

**NOTE:** Originally, I considered row binding. However, the differing columns and column names make this likely to be more trouble than it's worth. 

```{r}
all_visits <- v1 %>% 
  left_join(v2, by = "SUBJECT") %>% 
  left_join(v3, by = "SUBJECT") %>% 
  left_join(v4, by = "SUBJECT") %>% 
  left_join(v5, by = "SUBJECT")
```

```{r}
# The number of rows will change over time as we recruit people.
# However, we should never end up with more rows in the combined data than
# exist in the v1 data.
# Also, any changes to the number of columns should initiate an investigation
# into why.
dim(all_visits) # 263 2736
```

```{r}
rm(v1, v2, v3, v4, v5)
```

## Add group to the combined QDS data

Add the group membership variable we created above.

```{r}
all_visits <- all_visits %>% 
  left_join(group_qds, by = c("SUBJECT" = "id"))
```

```{r}
# The number of rows will change over time as we recruit people.
# However, we should never end up with more rows in the combined data than
# exist in the v1 data.
# Also, any changes to the number of columns should initiate an investigation
# into why.
dim(all_visits) # 263 2737
```

```{r}
rm(group_qds)
```

## Create an id variable

We will use participant id (currently called "SUBJECT") a lot for data cleaning and analysis. Let's convert it to the lowercase name "id" and make it the first column in the data.

```{r}
all_visits <- select(all_visits, id = SUBJECT, group, everything())
```

## Remove columns of missing data

There are quite a few columns that have missing values for all rows. We
drop those columns below.

```{r}
all_visits <- all_visits %>% 
  select(
    where(
      ~ !all(is.na(.x))
    )
  )
```

```{r}
ncol(all_visits) # 2713. So, 2737 - 2713 = 24 columns dropped.
```

## 🧮Recode/calculate variables by section

1. Make variable names more descriptive
2. Change skip values (e.g., 9, 99, etc.) to missing
3. Make factor versions of categorical variables

**NOTE:** Can't put this section higher because we need to do the steps above first.

**NOTE on changing variable names:** The variable names aren't very descriptive. At first, my plan was to resist the urge to change them in this file. My thought was that I wanted the data that comes out of this file to have variable names that match the variables names in the codebook files. Then I realized, however, that none of the calculated variables will be in the codebook files anyway. Also, there isn't a codebook file for the combined survey data set. So, we can go ahead and rename variables in this file. We will either have to create a new codebook for the combined data or just live without one. 

**NOTE on calculating over multiple visits:** Right now (2021-01-26), I'm only using this data to calculate baseline descriptive stats. Meaning, I'm only concerned with values at visit 1 and visit 2 (i.e., for some questions that weren't asked at visit 1). In the future, we will probably need to rewrite this code to iterate over multiple visits as well. For now, I'm not worrying about it.

### Helper functions

#### Convert 9's (or 7's, or 8's) to NA's and then add attributes back to vector.

First, I have to remove the "have_labelled" and "vctrs_vctr" class from each variable for if_else() to work.

But, I also need to keep the label attributes. They are erased when I convert the 9's to NA.

```{r}
nines_to_na <- function(x, nines) {
  # Store the attributes
  x_attr <- attributes(x)
  # Remove "haven_labelled" and "vctrs_vctr" from class list so that if_else()
  # will work.
  # Set class of column to whatever is remaining in the class list.
  classes <- class(x)
  class(x) <- classes[!class(x) %in% c("haven_labelled", "vctrs_vctr")]
  # Convert 9's to NA's
  x <- if_else(x %in% nines, NA_real_, x)
  # Add attributes back to the vector
  attributes(x) <- x_attr
  # Return x
  x
}

# For testing
# test <- all_visits
# test$SQ_13[1] <- 7
# test$SQ_13[3] <- 9
# test$SQ_13[4] <- 99
# test %>% 
#   select(SQ_13) %>% 
#   mutate(SQ_13_test = nines_to_na(SQ_13, c(7, 9, 99))) %>% 
#   pull(SQ_13_test) %>% 
#   attributes()
# rm(test)
```

#### Use SPSS labels as factor levels for categorical variables

```{r}
# For use inside across()
spss_to_fs <- function(x) {
  levs <- attr(x, "labels")
  labs <- names(levs)
  x_f <- factor(x, levs, labs)
  x_f
}

# For testing
# all_visits %>%
#   select(SQ_2, SQ_3) %>%
#   mutate(
#     across(
#       everything(),
#       spss_to_fs,
#       .names = "{col}_f"
#     )
#   )
```

### 1. Administrative and Exclusion Criteria

* Visit 1, Section 1, Q1-Q19
* Visit 2, Q1-Q7

Date and Time Wizard: Time_to_complete

```{r}
# Ported from Visit 1.sps
all_visits <- all_visits %>% 
  mutate(
    time_to_complete_V1 = ENDTIME1 - CTIME_V1
  )

# VARIABLE LABELS
attr(all_visits$time_to_complete_V1, "label") <- "finish time minus start time"
```

**NOTE on gender:**
Gender does not always agree across visits. For now, we are just going to use gender at visit 1.

```{r}
all_visits <- all_visits %>%
  # Make variable names more descriptive
  rename(
    gender_v1 = GENDER_V1,
    hispanic = SQ_2,
    race = SQ_3, # May have to change this to dem3v1
    age = SQ_4
  ) %>% 
  # Make factor versions of categorical variables
  mutate(
    across(
      c(gender_v1, hispanic, race),
      spss_to_fs,
      .names = "{col}_f"
    )
  )
```

### 2. Screening Questions (SQ)

* Visit 1, Section 2, Q20-Q30

**NOTE on SQ_18, Which of the following forms of media do you use?**
We may eventually want to combine these into a "multiple forms" category.

```{r}

Calculate jail time

Helpful scoring documentation: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Ware/publication/291994160_How_to_score_SF-12_items/links/58dfc467a6fdcc41bf920748/How-to-score-SF-12-items.pdf

Pull out the SF-12 items

```{r}
sf12 <- select(all_visits, HS1_V1:HS12_V1)
names(sf12) <- c(
  "gh1", "pf02", "pf04", "rp2", "rp3", "re2", "re3", "bp2", "mh3", "vt2", "mh4", 
  "sf2"
)
sf12 <- mutate(sf12, across(everything(), as.numeric))
```

#### Step 1. Data cleaning and item recoding

```{r}
sf12 <- sf12 %>% 
  mutate(
    # Recode 7, 8, 9 to NA
    across(
      everything(),
      .fns = function(x) {
        x[x == 7] <- NA
        x[x == 8] <- NA
        x[x == 9] <- NA
        x
      }
    )
  )
```

Make sure all items are within range.

```{r rows.print=12}
sf12 %>% 
  summarise(
    across(
      .cols = everything(),
      .fns = list(min = ~min(.x, na.rm = TRUE), max = ~max(.x, na.rm = TRUE))
    )
  ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = c("column", ".value"),
    names_sep = "_"
  )
```

They are all in range, now reverse scoring for GH1 (item #1), BP2 (item #8), MH3 (item #9), and VT2 (item #10). These directions come from https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Ware/publication/291994160_How_to_score_SF-12_items/links/58dfc467a6fdcc41bf920748/How-to-score-SF-12-items.pdf, pg. 22.

Poor health should be low score, and good health should be high score.

```{r}
sf12 <- sf12 %>% 
  mutate(
    across(
      .cols = c(gh1, bp2),
      .fns  = ~ case_when(
        .x == 1 ~ 5,
        .x == 2 ~ 4,
        .x == 3 ~ 3,
        .x == 4 ~ 2,
        .x == 5 ~ 1
      ),
      .names = "r{col}"
    ),
    across(
      .cols = c(mh3, vt2),
      .fns  = ~ case_when(
        .x == 1 ~ 6,
        .x == 2 ~ 5,
        .x == 3 ~ 4,
        .x == 4 ~ 3,
        .x == 5 ~ 2,
        .x == 6 ~ 1
      ),
      .names = "r{col}"
    )
  )
```

#### Step 2: Create indicator variables from item response choices

```{r}

More specifically, what is the value of Substance_abuse_hs when S29_V1 does not equal 0? Is Substance_abuse_hs just missing? Don't need this right now for the big descriptive table though.
