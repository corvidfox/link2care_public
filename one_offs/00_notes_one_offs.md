# Notes on the one-offs folder

This is folder is for quick little one-off analyses that people sometimes request. They are typically data checks to see if a research question is likely to be answerable or not. Save them here in case they are ever needed again in the future. If the one-off analysis turns into a more fully developed paper or project, then move the related file(s) out of this folder into a paper or project folder.
