# ‚≠êÔ∏èOverview

This file was used to analyse the breakdown of payment method assignment in each study arm, as well as the demographic breakdown of subjects that participated in each visit.

## Notes

Payment methods for remuneration payments changed during the course of the study. The number of subjects in each study arm that experienced each payment method were isolated for reporting.

Many subjects missed one or more visits. The demographics of subjects attending each visit were isolated for analysis to assess for statistically significant differences.

## Combined Data Set

We imported our Combined Data Set

```{r}
combined_data_path <- here::here(
  "data", "Combined Participant Data", "combined_data_03.rds"
  )
```

Import the data.
Check the most recent file modification dates and print for user when this file is being sourced.

```{r message=FALSE}
combined_data <- readr::read_rds(combined_data_path)

# Print a message for when this file is being sourced

# Modifications

## Creation of Payment Structure Subset

We created a temporary version of our combined data set to examine enrollment in each payment structure. This involved isolation of our target variables (group, payment_structure, visit, id), consolidation of group into 'UCM' and 'Smartphone' groups, and consolidation of all 'UCM' subjects into the 'original' payment structure.

```{r}
payment_data <- combined_data |>
  dplyr::select(group, payment_structure, id, visit) |>
  dplyr::mutate(
    payment_structure = dplyr::case_when(
      group == "Usual Case Management (UCM)" ~ 'Original',
      TRUE ~ payment_structure
    ),
    group = dplyr::case_when(
      group != 'Usual Case Management (UCM)' ~ 'Smartphone',
      TRUE ~ group
    )
  )
```

## Isolation of Desired Variables

We isolated only the desired variables from our data set.

```{r}
combined_data <- combined_data |>
  dplyr::select(
    id, group, visit, subj_gender, subj_race_ethn, subj_race, subj_hispanic,
    subj_age, drop_flag
    )
```

## Modification of Visit (Pivot to Wide, Binary 'Full Attendance' Variable)

We modified our data set to pivot our data from long format (subject-visit) to wide format (subject), wherein attendance at each visit was indicated with a binary 'TRUE'/'FALSE' logical. We further calculated a binary outcome variable indicating if a subject did or did not attended all study visits.

```{r}
combined_data <- combined_data |>
  dplyr::mutate(
    'TRUE' = TRUE
    ) |>
  tidyr::pivot_wider(
    names_from = visit, values_from = 'TRUE', values_fill = FALSE
    ) |>
  dplyr::rename_at(
    c(
      'Visit 1: Baseline', 'Visit 2: Randomization', 
      'Visit 3: 1 Month Follow-Up', 'Visit 4: 3 Month Follow-Up',
      'Visit 5: 6 Month Follow-Up'
      ),
    ~c('v1', 'v2', 'v3', 'v4', 'v5')
    ) |>
  dplyr::mutate(
    full_attendance = if_else(v1 & v2 & v3 & v4 & v5, TRUE, FALSE)
    ) |>
  dplyr::relocate(id, v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, full_attendance)
```

## Reduction of Race Categories (3 Categories)

We modified race to only include 3 categories: White, Black, and Other.

```{r}
combined_data <- combined_data |>
  dplyr::mutate(
    subj_race_3cat = dplyr::case_when(
      !(subj_race %in% c("White", "Black or African American")) ~ "Other",
      TRUE ~ subj_race
    )
  ) |>
  dplyr::mutate(subj_race_3cat = factor(subj_race_3cat))
```

# Identification of Variable Types

We identified our continuous and categorical variables of interest.

```{r}
cat_cols <- c(
  'subj_gender', 'subj_race_3cat', 'subj_hispanic', 'subj_race_ethn', 'group'
  )
cont_cols <- c('subj_age')
```

# Payment Structure Counts

We examined the counts for each visit:

```{r}
table(payment_data |>
  dplyr::filter(visit == "Visit 1: Baseline") |>
  dplyr::select(group, payment_structure))
```

```{r}
table(payment_data |>
  dplyr::filter(visit == "Visit 2: Randomization") |>
  dplyr::select(group, payment_structure))
```

```{r}
table(payment_data |>
  dplyr::filter(visit == "Visit 3: 1 Month Follow-Up") |>
  dplyr::select(group, payment_structure))
```

```{r}
table(payment_data |>
  dplyr::filter(visit == "Visit 4: 3 Month Follow-Up") |>
  dplyr::select(group, payment_structure))
```

```{r}
table(payment_data |>
  dplyr::filter(visit == "Visit 5: 6 Month Follow-Up") |>
  dplyr::select(group, payment_structure))
```

We also examined the 'ever' counts for each payment method, examining both the UCM and Smartphone groups.

```{r}
#UCM
length(unique(pull(
  combined_data |> 
    filter(group == 'Usual Case Management (UCM)') |>
    select(id)
  )))
#137
```

```{r}
# Smartphone, Original
length(unique(pull(
  payment_data |> 
    filter(group != 'Usual Case Management (UCM)') |> 
    filter(payment_structure == 'Original') |> 
    select(id)
  )))
# 47
```

```{r}
# Smartphone, 1st Modification
length(unique(pull(
  payment_data |> 
    filter(group != 'Usual Case Management (UCM)') |> 
    filter(payment_structure == '1st Modification') |> 
    select(id)
  )))
# 50
```

```{r}
# Smartphone, 2nd Modification
length(unique(pull(
  payment_data |> 
    filter(group != 'Usual Case Management (UCM)') |> 
    filter(payment_structure == '2nd Modification') |> 
    select(id)
  )))
# 200
```

```{r}
rm(payment_data)
```


# Demographic Summary Tables

## Total (All Groups)

### Baseline

Subjects were further filtered to exclude any subjects that were marked for exclusion for any reason other than failure to attend the randomization visit.

```{r}
combined_data <- combined_data |>

  combined_data |> 
    dplyr::filter(v1) |>
    dplyr::filter((drop_flag & is.na(group)) | (!is.na(group) & !drop_flag))
     )
# 442
```

```{r}

# Analyses

## Binary Outcome ("Attended All Visits" vs "Did Not Attend All Visits")

We performed binary analyses to examine for any statistically significant associations between our demographics and attendance at all visits.

### All "Non-Excluded" Subjects

#### Summary Statistics

First, summary statistics were generated to examine the two groups ("full attendance" vs "non-full attendance").

Full Attendance:
```{r}
summary_stats(
  combined_data |> 
       dplyr::filter(!drop_flag) |>
       dplyr::filter(full_attendance),
  'v1', 
  cont_cols, cat_cols
  )
```

Non-Full Attendance:
```{r}
summary_stats(
  combined_data |> 
       dplyr::filter(!drop_flag) |>
       dplyr::filter(!full_attendance),
  'v1', 
  cont_cols, cat_cols
  )
```

#### Continuous Numeric (Age)

As both groups had well over 30 subjects, age was treated as approximately normally distributed under the central limit theorem. The variances appeared to be approximately equal, which was supported by the F-test of equal variances (F = 1.1254, dof = 275/162 p = 0.409, two-sided test).

```{r}
var.test(subj_age ~ full_attendance, 
         combined_data |>
           dplyr::filter(!drop_flag), 
         alternative = "two.sided")
```

The two-sided t-test of means with equal variance indicated a statistically significant difference in mean age across attendance status (t = 2.4247, dof = 437, p = 0.01573)

```{r}
x_vals <- combined_data |> 
  dplyr::filter(!drop_flag) |>
  dplyr::filter(full_attendance) |>
  dplyr::select(subj_age)

y_vals <- combined_data |> 
  dplyr::filter(!drop_flag) |>
  dplyr::filter(!full_attendance) |>
  dplyr::select(subj_age)

t.test(x_vals, y_vals, alternative = 'two.sided', var.equal=TRUE)
```

```{r}

#### Categorical Variables

Categorical variables were tested using a Chi-Square or Fisher's Exact Test for Association.

Gender had expected counts < 5 in cells, due to low counts in the Gender of "Other". As such, Fisher's Exact Test was utilized. Fisher's exact testing demonstrated no statistically significant association between Gender and attendance compliance (p=0.2058).

```{r}
gender_table <- table(combined_data[['full_attendance']], combined_data[['subj_gender']])

fisher.test(gender_table)
```

```{r}
rm(gender_table)
```


Race had expected counts > 5 in all cells, and thus Chi-Square testing was utilized. This demonstrated no statistically significant association between Race and attendance status (X<sup>2</sup> = 1.748, dof = 2, p = 0.4173).

```{r}
race_table <- table(combined_data[['full_attendance']], combined_data[['subj_race_3cat']])

chisq.test(race_table)
```

```{r}
rm(race_table)
```


Ethnicity (Hispanic Origin) had expected counts > 5 in all cells, and thus Chi-Square testing was utilized. This demonstrated no statistically significant association between Ethnicity and attendance status (X<sup>2</sup> = 2.8658 x 10<sup>-30</sup>, dof = 1, p = 1).

```{r}
ethnicity_table <- table(combined_data[['full_attendance']], combined_data[['subj_hispanic']])

chisq.test(ethnicity_table)
```

```{r}
rm(ethnicity_table)
```

Study arm had expected counts > 5 in all cells, and thus Chi-Square testing was utilized. This demonstrated no statistically significant association between study arm and attendance status (X<sup>2</sup> = 4.1981, dof = 2, p = 0.1226).

```{r}
arm_table <- table(combined_data[['full_attendance']], combined_data[['group']])

chisq.test(arm_table)
```

```{r}
rm(arm_table)
```

### Randomized Subjects Only

We further restricted our comparison to only randomized subjects that were not marked for exclusion.

```{r}
comp_data <- combined_data |>
  dplyr::filter(!drop_flag)
```

#### Summary Statistics

First, summary statistics were generated to examine the two groups ("full attendance" vs "non-full attendance").

Full Attendance:
```{r}
summary_stats(
  comp_data |> 
       dplyr::filter(full_attendance),
  'v1', 
  cont_cols, cat_cols
  )
```

Non-Full Attendance:
```{r}
summary_stats(
  comp_data |> 
       dplyr::filter(!full_attendance),
  'v1', 
  cont_cols, cat_cols
  )
```

#### Continuous Numeric (Age)

As both groups had well over 30 subjects, age was treated as approximately normally distributed under the central limit theorem. The variances appeared to be approximately equal, which was supported by the F-test of equal variances (F = 1.1782, dof = 239/162 p = 0.2619, two-sided test).

```{r}
var.test(subj_age ~ full_attendance, comp_data, 
         alternative = "two.sided")
```

The two-sided t-test of means with equal variance indicated a statistically significant difference in mean age across attendance status (t = 2.1448, dof = 401, p = 0.03257)

```{r}
x_vals <- comp_data |> 
  filter(full_attendance) |>
  select(subj_age)

y_vals <- comp_data |> 
  filter(!full_attendance) |>
  select(subj_age)

t.test(x_vals, y_vals, alternative = 'two.sided', var.equal=TRUE)
```

```{r}
rm(x_vals)
rm(y_vals)
```


#### Categorical Variables

Categorical variables were tested using a Chi-Square or Fisher's Exact Test for Association.

chisq.test(race_table)
```

```{r}
rm(race_table)
```


Ethnicity (Hispanic Origin) had expected counts > 5 in all cells, and thus Chi-Square testing was utilized. This demonstrated no statistically significant association between Ethnicity and attendance status (X<sup>2</sup> = 1.3398 x 10<sup>-30</sup>, dof = 1, p = 1).

```{r}
ethnicity_table <- table(comp_data[['full_attendance']], comp_data[['subj_hispanic']])

chisq.test(ethnicity_table)
```

```{r}
rm(ethnicity_table)
```

Study arm had expected counts > 5 in all cells, and thus Chi-Square testing was utilized. This demonstrated no statistically significant association between study arm and attendance status (X<sup>2</sup> = 4.1981, dof = 2, p = 0.1226).

```{r}
arm_table <- table(comp_data[['full_attendance']], comp_data[['group']])
