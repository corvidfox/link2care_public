title: "Import Link2Care Survey Data - QDS Visit 1"

# ‚≠êÔ∏èOverview

This file is used to import the Link2Care follow-up visit survey data and do some initial data cleaning. 

**NOTE on using multiple import code files:**
Previously, I was trying to clean all the separate data frames (i.e, QDS v1-v5, REDCap, and Master Log) in a single Rmd file. 

In theory, this is more efficient than importing and cleaning each visit file separately. For example, we can clean "race" instead of cleaning "race_v1", "race_v2", etc.

However, there are at least two issues with that approach:   
1. There are intentional differences in the variable names (e.g., "V1" and "V2"), and unintentional errors (e.g., HEIGHT_3) in the variable names, from data frame to data frame that make combining them very difficult.   
2. These differences and errors can be "fixed"; however, doing so makes the variable names so different from the codebook that the codebook is barely usable.

For now, I'm going to try importing and cleaning each data file using a separate code file. There may be opportunities to make this more efficient in the future.

**NOTE on data sources:**
* The QDS data is exported from QDS in SPSS data format. The data has to be exported by visit (i.e., v1, v2, ... v5). The SPSS data is then added to the UTHealth servers.

* Some of the v3-v5 visits are also done using REDCap. That data is exported from REDCap and added to the UTHealth servers.

**NOTE on Kiteworks:**
Currently, I'm importing all of this data from the UTHealth server. The data should also be available on Kiteworks if you are unable to connect to the server for some reason.

# 2021-07-12: v5 imported with 133 rows and 639 columns.
```


# Clean column names

We have to make the column names match across visits so that we can merge all of the individual QDS data frames into one.

## Reorder columnn names and manual changes

1. The columns in the data are not arranged in the order that they exist in the actual QDS survey for some reason. This makes the data harder to work with, and it will make the codebook we eventually create difficult to use. So, we are going to reorder them. To prevent us from typing out 810 variable names manually, we are going to read-in the variable names from the codebook and then create a blog of text that we copy and paste into a code chunk using `select()` below. Prepping the codebook to be able to do this took a long time and isn't very future-proof. However, we should only have to do this step once. As changes occur to QDS in the future, we can just update the code chunk with the `select()` function.

2. There are some instances where it makes sense to make manual changes to column names now, before the standardization process below. For example, the MMSE columns. It's better to manually change them now because after standardize_col_names you can no longer cut and paste from the Word codebooks. Also, it becomes difficult to be sure which variables in the data correspond to which variables in the codebook (e.g., "mms_4" and "mms_4v").There will also be additional manual changes made after the standardization process. 

### Extract content from Word codebooks

_See "Notes on cleaning individual L2C data sets for merging" for the rationale, style guidelines, and instructions for this section._

```{r eval=FALSE}
# This shouldn't need to be run again in the future. Just leaving it in the code to preserve an accurate history of what was done. 
word_cb_content_list <- map(
  .x = c(1:5),
  .f = function(x) {
    word_cb_full_path <- paste0("docs/codebooks/", "L2C_V", x, " Codebook.docx")
    word_cb_content <- read_docx(word_cb_full_path) %>% 
      docx_summary() %>% 
      mutate(visit = x)
  }
)
```

Keep the parts of the codebook we are interested in for this process (i.e., section names and column names)

```{r eval=FALSE}
# This shouldn't need to be run again in the future. Just leaving it in the code to preserve an accurate history of what was done. 
word_cb_secs_cols_list <- map(
  .x = word_cb_content_list,
  .f = get_sec_and_col_names_from_word_cb
)
```

Clean up the section names. For example, convert `Sect-0.*****Admin*****` to `Admin`

```{r eval=FALSE}
# This shouldn't need to be run again in the future. Just leaving it in the code to preserve an accurate history of what was done. 
word_cb_secs_cols_list <- map(
  .x = word_cb_secs_cols_list,
  .f = clean_word_cb_sec_names
)
```

Create a new column in the new_name = old_name format that we can copy and paste into `select()` later.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# This shouldn't need to be run again in the future. Just leaving it in the code to preserve an accurate history of what was done. 
word_cb_secs_cols_list <- map(
  .x = word_cb_secs_cols_list,
  .f = create_copy_paste_col
)
```

Record the sections that are completed at visit 1. We will use this for checking to make sure all of the correct questionnaire sections merge later.

```{r}
# This shouldn't need to be run again in the future. Just leaving it in the code to preserve an accurate history of what was done. 
q_sections <- map(
  .x = word_cb_secs_cols_list,
  .f = ~ unique(.x$section_name)
)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
# This shouldn't need to be run again in the future. Just leaving it in the code to preserve an accurate history of what was done. 
write_rds(q_sections, "data/qds_questionnaire_sections.rds")
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
# This shouldn't need to be run again in the future. Just leaving it in the code to preserve an accurate history of what was done. 
rm(q_sections)
```

**NOTE:** There are more columns in the data than there are in the codebooks. This is due to calculated variables that were created when the raw QDS data was passed through an SPSS script. We may change that process at some point in the future. 

Have R write out the column names in the order that they appear in QDS. Then, we will copy and paste into the `select()` function. We will do this instead of directly passing the column order to `select()` because we need to make some manual changes to the column names now. Again, we should only have to do this once, and all future updates will be done directly in the code chunk with `select()`. 

### v1: Reorder columnn names and manual changes

**Change log:**

On 2021-06-10, VISIT_TYPE was added to QDS.

On 2021-06-05, Joe Waring found a discrepancy between the way Tobacco 26 was being asked in QDS and REDCap. 

In QDS, T26_V1, T26_V3, T26_V4, and T26_V5 read:

Which option would give you the best chance for quitting smoking?
1	=	Medications
2	=	Counseling
3	=	Both medications and counseling
4	=	Smartphone app
5	=	Both smartphone app and medications
6	=	Quitting "cold turkey" - without counseling or medications
9	=	skipped

And only one answer choice was possible.

In REDCap, t26_v1 reads:

If you were to try to quit smoking, which of the following would you prefer to receive: (select all that apply)

1 t26_v1___1 Medications
2 t26_v1___2 Group Counseling
3 t26_v1___3 Smartphone app
4 t26_v1___4 In person individual counseling
5 t26_v1___5 Helpline phone counseling
6 t26_v1___6 None of the above

Where multiple answers are possible and t26_v1___1 - t26_v1___6 are dummy variables.

On 2021-06-30 the QDS survey was changed to be more like the REDCap survey. The QDS data now has T26A_V1, T26A_V1A, T26A_V1B, T26A_V1C, T26A_V1D, T26A_V1E, and T26A_V1F that correspond to t26_v1___1 - t26_v1___6 in REDCap.

Remember that because of a naming error with T3B_V1, T26_V1 was already manually changed to T27 in the codebook by MBC. Changing "T26_V1" (the name that appears in the outdated codebook) to "T26A_V1" (the name that actually appears in the data frame now).

We manually make these changes in the code chunk below. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# This shouldn't need to be run again in the future. Just leaving it in the code to preserve an accurate history of what was done. 
# paste(word_cb_secs_cols_list[[1]][["copy_and_paste"]], collapse = ", ")
```

```{r}
v1_test <- v1 %>% 
  select(
    TODAY_V1, VISIT_TYPE, II_V1, VISIT_V1, TEST_V1, 
    
    # Add intuitive names to the screening question (demographic) variables

    SQ_14, SQ_15, SQ_16, SQ_17, SQ_18, SQ_18A, SQ_18B, SQ_18C, SQ_18D, SQ_18E, 
    SQ_18F, SQ_18G, SQ_18H, SQ_18I, SQ_19, SQ_20, SQ_21, SQ_22, SQ_22A, SQ_22B, 
    SQ_22C, SQ_22D, SQ_22E, SQ_22F, SQ_22G, SQ_22H,
    
    # Changes to MMSE column names
    # In visit 1, the MMSE questions go MMS_4, MMS_4A-MMS_4F, COUNT, MMS4V, 
    # MMS4VA-MMS4VF, NUM, MMS_5. However, MMS4V should have been MMS_5 and 
    # MMS_5 should have been MMS_6, etc. This proliferates all the way down 
    # the questions. We need to fix these before the standardization process.

    # Better to do this now because after standardize_col_names you can no 
    # longer cut and paste from the Word codebooks. Also, it becomes difficult 
    # to be sure which variables in the data correspond to which variables in 
    # the codebook (e.g., "mms_4" and "mms_4v").

    # Additionally, I'm going to add the section name (mms) in front of some of 
    # the column names that don't include it. For example, RECAL1 to mms_recall1.

## Standardize column names

* Remove _v{1, 2, 3} and v{1, 2, 3} from column names   
* Replace spaces with underscores   
* Convert to lower case   
* Add underscore in-between the abbreviated tool name and question number   

This won‚Äôt be perfect, but it will drastically reduce the number of manual changes we have to make.

```{r}
# For testing
walk(
  .x = paste0("v", 1:3, "_test"),
  .f = function(df_name) {
    df <- get(df_name, envir = .GlobalEnv)
    df <- rename_with(df, standardize_col_names)
    assign(df_name, df, envir = .GlobalEnv)
  }
)
```

```{r}
walk(
  .x = paste0("v", 1:5),
  .f = function(df_name) {
    df <- get(df_name, envir = .GlobalEnv)
    df <- rename_with(df, standardize_col_names)
    assign(df_name, df, envir = .GlobalEnv)
  }
)
```

All of the variables above will have to be investigated and fixed manually later.


# Merge visits 1 through 5

```{r}
qds_all_visits <- v1_test %>% 
  bind_rows(v2_test) %>% 
  bind_rows(v3_test) %>% 
  arrange(subject, visit)

# qds_all_visits
```

# Left off here... check the names for problems

```{r}
data.frame(names(qds_all_visits)) %>% slice(1000:1046)
```

Renumber the bh variables

```{r}
v1 %>% select(starts_with("bh18b"))
v3 %>% select(starts_with("bh18b"))
qds_all_visits %>% select(starts_with("bh_18b"))
```



# Additional data cleaning

* Make a couple more column name changes   
* Make id the first column   
* Carry forward time-invariant variables   
* Drop `test`. Not sure why it exists.   
* Drop `subject_1`. Not sure why it exists.   
* Move bh_14bd to behind bh_14bw

```{r}
# qds_all_visits <- 
qds_all_visits %>% 
  rename(id = subject, date_visit = today) %>% 
  select(-test, -subject_1) %>% 
  relocate(bh_14bd, .after = bh_14bw) %>% 
  select(id, everything())
```

```{r}
# Future proof this by checking to see if the variables have changed over time.
# If this test fails in the future, come back and make adjustments to how we 
# handle columns as needed.

# Clean variable names

_See "Notes on cleaning individual L2C data sets for merging" for the rationale, style guidelines, and instructions for this section._
  
## Extract content from Word codebook

```{r}
v1_cb_content <- read_docx("docs/codebooks/L2C_V1 Codebook.docx") %>% 
  docx_summary()
```

### Keep the variables of interest only

```{r}
v1_cb_col_names <- v1_cb_content %>%
  filter(style_name %in% c("section_name", "cb_col_name", "col_name")) %>% 
  select(doc_index, style_name:text) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "style_name",
    values_from = "text"
  )
```

```{r}
rm(v1_cb_content)
```

### Clean section names

```{r}
v1_cb_col_names <- v1_cb_col_names %>%
  mutate(
    # Remove "Sect-number."
    section_name = str_remove(section_name, "Sect-\\d{1,}."),
    # Remove asterisks
    section_name = str_remove_all(section_name, "\\*"),
    # Remove empty spaces
    section_name = str_trim(section_name),
    # Clean " (SQ_7 - SQ_11)" from exclusion criteria
    section_name = str_remove(section_name, " \\(SQ_7 - SQ_11\\)")
  ) %>% 
  # Fill section down across rows
  fill(section_name)
```

### Record the sections that are completed at visit 1

We will use this for checking to make sure all of the correct questionnaire sections merge later.

**NOTE:** If you rerun this section, you must run the files to clean v2-v5 again.

```{r}
q_sections <- list(v1 = unique(v1_cb_col_names$section_name))
# q_sections[["v1"]]
```

```{r}
write_rds(q_sections, "data/questionnaire_section.rds")
```

```{r}
rm(q_sections)
```

### Reduce to one row per column

Currently, cb_col_name and col_name are on separate rows. We will spread the different column names vertically across rows so that we can reduce the data frame down to one row per column.

```{r}
v1_cb_col_names <- v1_cb_col_names %>%
  # Spread cb_col_name across rows
  fill(cb_col_name) %>% 
  # Spread col_name across rows within cb_col_name
  group_by(cb_col_name) %>% 
  fill(col_name, .direction = "up") %>% 
  # # For data checking
  # filter(section_name == "Self-Rated Health Questionnaire") %>%
  # ungroup() %>%
  # slice(-1) %>%
  # summarise(
  #   length(unique(cb_col_name)),
  #   length(unique(col_name))
  # )
  group_by(cb_col_name) %>% 
  filter(row_number() == 1) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  # Remove first row
  slice(-1)
```

```{r}
dim(v1_cb_col_names) # 725   4
```

### Standardize new column names

* Remove _V1 and V1 from column names
* Replace spaces with underscores
* Convert to lower case
* Add underscore in-between the abbreviated tool name and question number

```{r}
v1_cb_col_names <- v1_cb_col_names %>%
  mutate(
    # Remove _V1 from column name
    # Remove V1 at end of column name (e.g., DEM1V1)
    # Don't include values for col_name that were changed in the Word
    # document.
    col_name = if_else(
      is.na(col_name),
      str_replace(cb_col_name, "_V1|V1", ""),
      col_name
    ),
    # Replace spaces with underscores
    col_name = str_replace_all(col_name, " ", "_"),
    # Convert to lower case
    col_name = str_to_lower(col_name),
    # Add underscore in-between the abbreviated tool name and question number
    col_name = str_replace(col_name, "([a-z])(\\d)", "\\1_\\2")
  )
```

## New column: Visit type

On 2021-06-10, VISIT_TYPE was added to QDS, but not the codebook. Therefore, we will create a new row for v1_cb_col_names that will include the VISIT_TYPE variables that would have been there if it were in the codebook. 

```{r}
v1_cb_col_names <- v1_cb_col_names %>%
  add_row(
    doc_index    = NA,
    section_name = "Admin",
    cb_col_name  = "VISIT_TYPE",
    col_name     = "visit_type",
    .after       = which(v1_cb_col_names$cb_col_name == "TODAY_V1")
  )
```

## New columns: Tobacco 26 questions

On 2021-06-05, Joe Waring found a discrepancy between the way Tobacco 26 was being asked in QDS and REDCap. 

In QDS, T26_V1, T26_V3, T26_V4, and T26_V5 read:

Which option would give you the best chance for quitting smoking?
1	=	Medications
2	=	Counseling
3	=	Both medications and counseling
4	=	Smartphone app
5	=	Both smartphone app and medications
6	=	Quitting "cold turkey" - without counseling or medications
9	=	skipped

And only one answer choice was possible.

In REDCap, t26_v1 reads:

If you were to try to quit smoking, which of the following wouldyou prefer to receive: (select all that apply)

1 t26_v1___1 Medications
2 t26_v1___2 Group Counseling
3 t26_v1___3 Smartphone app
4 t26_v1___4 In person individual counseling
5 t26_v1___5 Helpline phone counseling
6 t26_v1___6 None of the above

Where multiple answers are possible and t26_v1___1 - t26_v1___6 are dummy variables.

On 2021-06-30 the QDS survey was changed to be more like the REDCap survey. The QDS data now has T26A_V1, T26A_V1A, T26A_V1B, T26A_V1C, T26A_V1D, T26A_V1E, and T26A_V1F that correspond to t26_v1___1 - t26_v1___6 in REDCap. 

These variables will not exist in the Word codebooks, so we will manually add them to v1_cb_col_names and manually make sure they follow naming conventions.

Remember that because of a naming error with T3B_V1, T26_V1 was already manually changed to T27 in the codebook by MBC. Changing "T26_V1" (the name that appears in the outdated codebook) to "T26A_V1" (the name that actually appears in the data frame now).

```{r}
v1_cb_col_names <- v1_cb_col_names %>% 
  mutate(cb_col_name = if_else(cb_col_name == "T26_V1", "T26A_V1", cb_col_name))
```

Next, create new rows for v1_cb_col_names that will add the T26 dummy variables that would have been there if the new variables were in the codebook. 

```{r}
v1_cb_col_names <- v1_cb_col_names %>%
  add_row(
    doc_index    = NA,
    section_name = "Tobacco History Questionnaire",
    cb_col_name  = c(
      "T26A_V1A", "T26A_V1B", "T26A_V1C", "T26A_V1D", "T26A_V1E", "T26A_V1F"
    ),
    col_name     = c("t_27a", "t_27b", "t_27c", "t_27d", "t_27e", "t_27f"),
    .after       = which(v1_cb_col_names$cb_col_name == "T26A_V1")
  )
```

## Check for duplicate column names

Check to make sure this process didn't accidentally create any duplicate column names

```{r}
test_that("No duplicate col_names were created in the visit 1 data.", {
  check_dup_col_name <- v1_cb_col_names %>% 
    group_by(col_name) %>% 
    filter(max(row_number()) > 1) %>% 
    pull(col_name)
  
  expect_length(check_dup_col_name, 0)
})
```

## Save column names

Save v1_cb_col_names as a key that maps the new names to the old names in case we need that information in the future. Possibly for the codebook.

**NOTE:** If you rerun this section, you must run the files to clean v2-v5 again.

```{r}
v1_col_names_key <- v1_cb_col_names %>%  
  # Drop doc_index column
  select(-doc_index) %>% 
  # Add df identifier
  mutate(df = "v1") %>% 
  select(df, everything())
```

```{r}
col_name_keys <- list(v1 = v1_col_names_key)
# col_name_keys[["v1"]]
```

```{r}
write_rds(col_name_keys, "data/col_name_keys.rds")
```

```{r}
rm(col_name_keys, v1_cb_col_names)
```

## Differences between codebook columns and data columns

Check to see what differences, if any, exist between the columns in the codebook and the columns in the actual data frame.

```{r}
in_cb_not_df <- setdiff(v1_col_names_key$cb_col_name, names(v1))
in_cb_not_df
```

There are **0** column names in the codebook that don't appear in the data.   

```{r}
# Future proof this by checking to see if the variables have changed over time.
# If this test fails in the future, come back and make adjustments to how we 
# handle columns as needed.
test_that("The expected columns exist in the codebook, but not the v1 df.", {
  expect_equal(
    length(in_cb_not_df),
    0L
  )
})
```

Now, check for columns that exist in the data frame, but not the codebook.

```{r}
in_df_not_cb <- setdiff(names(v1), v1_col_names_key$cb_col_name)
# in_df_not_cb
```

Drop SUBJECT1. It's missing in every row.

```{r}
v1 <- select(v1, -SUBJECT1)
```

```{r}
in_df_not_cb <- setdiff(names(v1), v1_col_names_key$cb_col_name)
# in_df_not_cb
```

```{r}
# Future proof this by checking to see if the variables have changed over time.
# If this test fails in the future, come back and make adjustments to how we 
# handle columns as needed.
test_that("The expected columns exist in the v1 df, but not the v1 codebook.", {
  expect_equal(
    length(in_df_not_cb),
    77L
  )
})
```

The remainder of these variables are calculated variables created by the SPSS export script. We will save them in a separate data frame and deal with them later. 

```{r}
v1_spss_calc_vars <- v1 %>% 
  select(id = SUBJECT, visit = VISIT_V1, all_of(in_df_not_cb))
```

```{r}
write_sav(v1_spss_calc_vars, "data/v1_spss_calc_vars.sav")
```

Remove calculated variables from the v1 data. This makes it easier to merge with the other QDS data frames later.

```{r}
v1 <- v1 %>% select(!all_of(in_df_not_cb))
```

2021-07-09: After adding visit_type and the T26 dummy variables, the expected number of columns in v1 changes from 725 to 732.

```{r}
# Future proof this by checking to see if the variables have changed over time.
# If this test fails in the future, come back and make adjustments to how we 
# handle columns as needed.
test_that("The expected number of columns exist in the v1 df after cleaning.", {
  expect_equal(
    length(names(v1)),
    732L
  )
})
```

Clean up

```{r}
rm(v1_spss_calc_vars, in_cb_not_df, in_df_not_cb)
```

## Replace variable names in the full data frame

Put them in the same order used in the codebook.

```{r}
v1 <- v1 %>% 
  select(all_of(v1_col_names_key$cb_col_name))

names(v1) <- v1_col_names_key$col_name
```


# üíæSave the data frame

```{r}
path <- "/Volumes/Link2Care/Participant Data/R Data/qds_v1_import.rds"
```

```{r}
write_rds(v1, path)
```
