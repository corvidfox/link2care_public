# ⭐️Overview

This file is used to import the Link2Care arrest data and do some initial data cleaning. 

**NOTE on data sources:**

The arrest data is securely transmitted by Dr. Gonzalez as an Excel file, which is stored on the the UTHealth servers in Participant Data > Arrest Data Requests.


# 📦Load packages

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
library(readr)
```


# 🌎Connect to UTH server 

```{bash eval=FALSE}
# Don't drill all the way down to live documents because not all of the data is in live documents.
open 'smb://islgpcifs.uthouston.edu/sph_research/Link2Care/'
```


# 📥Import data 

* Had to remove password from Excel sheet before import. Help -> Passwords -> Delete password.   
* Had to do a little bit of manual removal of text from dates (i.e., "CURRENTLY IN CUSTODY") in the Excel file.   

```{r}
arrest <- read_excel(
  "/Volumes/Link2Care/Participant Data/Arrest Data Requests/Current_Arrest Data_De-identified_2001-2234.xlsx",
  sheet = "Sheet1",
  col_names = c(
    "subject", "arrested", "arrested_date_baseline", paste("arrested_date", 1:5, sep = "_")
  ),
  col_types = c(
    "numeric", "text", rep("date", 6)
  ),
  na = c("", "None"),
  skip = 1
)
