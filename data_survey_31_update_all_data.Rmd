# 📥Import data 

We previously imported and did some initial cleaning of the following data sets:

* QDS (data_survey_01_qds_import.Rmd)   
* REDCap (data_survey_02_redcap_import.Rmd)    
* Master log (data_survey_03_master_log_import.Rmd)   
* Timeline followback (data_survey_04_tlfb_import.Rmd)   
* Arrest data (data_survey_05_arrests_import.Rmd)   
* Bridge sessions data (data_survey_06_bridge_sessions_import.Rmd)

```

## Arrest data

The arrest data is securely transmitted by Dr. Gonzalez as an Excel file, which is stored on the the UTHealth servers in Participant Data > Arrest Data Requests.

Before you can import the Excel file, you must open it and remove the password from the Excel sheet. File -> Passwords... -> Delete password.   

```{r}
source_rmd("data_survey_05_arrests_import.Rmd")

# Arrest data cleaned with 274 rows and 8 columns.
```

## Bridge sessions data

```{r}
source_rmd("data_survey_06_bridge_sessions_import.Rmd")

# 2022-07-11: Bridge session wide data cleaned with 376 rows and 20 columns.
```

## DDT data

```{r}
source_rmd("data_survey_07_ddt_import.Rmd")

# 2022-07-11: DDT data cleaned with 1516 rows and 4 columns.
```


# 🔄Merge data 

```{r}
source_rmd("data_survey_21_merge.Rmd")

# 2022-07-11: Combined Participant data cleaned with 1285 rows and 1205 columns.
```


# 🗑Clean up

Don't use `rm(list = ls())` because is causes R to drop the helper functions in data_survey_21_update_all_data.Rmd

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```
