# Used to do an initial cleaning of the QDS column names.
#   * Remove _v{1, 2, 3} and v{1, 2, 3} from column names
#   * Replace spaces with underscores
#   * Convert to lower case
#   * Add underscore in-between the abbreviated tool name and question number
# This wonâ€™t be perfect, but it will drastically reduce the number of manual changes we have to make.
