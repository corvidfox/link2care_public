# ⭐️Overview

This file is used to import the Link2Care DDT data and do some initial data cleaning. 

**NOTE on data sources:**

From James, 2021-08-09

It’s the delayed discount task that asks the participants 6-7 questions about money preferences after the complete the QDS. 

Question example:
Would you prefer 500 now or 1000 in 2 days.

The raw DDT data is on OneDrive. It’s located in Participant Data > DDT Data-Individual Files.

We also have a combined excel sheet that has the K & ED50 Values that Michael is interested in.  It’s located in Participant Data > SPSS Data > DDT.


# 📦Load packages

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(haven, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(readr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
```


# 📥Import data 

```{r}
path <- "../Participant Data/SPSS Data/DDT/L2C_DDT_Database_1.sav"
```

Check the most recent file modification dates on the UTHealth servers and print for user when this file is being sourced.

```{r}
cat(
  stringr::str_extract(path, "([^/]+$)"),
  "last modified on UTHealth server:",
  as.character(file.info(path)$mtime), "\n"
)
```

```{r}
ddt <- read_sav(path)

# Print a message for when this file is being sourced
cat(
  paste0(Sys.Date(), ":"),
  "DDT data", nrow(ddt), "rows and", ncol(ddt), "columns.\n"
)

# 2021-08-17: DDT data 303 rows and 9 columns.
```


# Data cleaning

## Clean column names 

```{r}
names(ddt) <- tolower(names(ddt))
```

## Change variable types

* Subject to character   
* Everything else to numeric    

```{r}
ddt <- ddt %>% 
  mutate(
    subject = as.character(subject),
    across(everything(), ~ ifelse(.x == ".", NA, .x)),
    across(-subject, as.numeric)
  )
```

## Convert from wide to long

```{r}
ddt <- ddt %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -subject,
    names_to = c(".value", "visit"),
    names_sep = "_v"
  ) %>% 
  rename(
    ddt_k = k,
    ddt_ed50 = ed50
  ) %>% 
  mutate(visit = as.numeric(visit))
```

## Data check: Make sure there is one row per subject/visit combination

```{r}
rows <- nrow(ddt)
id_visit_rows <- nrow(unique(ddt[c("subject", "visit")]))
if (rows != id_visit_rows) {
  stop(
    "The DDT data has ", id_visit_rows, " unique combinations of subject and vist;", 
    " however, ", rows, " were expected. Investigate further in data_survey_07_ddt_import.Rmd"
  )
}
```

  paste0(Sys.Date(), ":"),
  "DDT data cleaned with", nrow(ddt), "rows and", ncol(ddt), "columns.\n"
)

# 2022-07-11: DDT data cleaned with 1516 rows and 4 columns.
```


# 💾Save the data frame

```{r}
path <- "../Participant Data/R Data/ddt.rds"
```

```{r}
write_rds(ddt, path)
```

```{r}
cat(
  paste0(Sys.Date(), ":"),
  "DDT data saved to", path, "\n"
)

# 2022-07-11: DDT data saved to ../Participant Data/R Data/ddt.rds 
```


# 🗑Clean up

Don't use `rm(list = ls())` because is causes R to drop the helper functions in data_survey_21_update_all_data.Rmd

```{r}
rm(list = ls()[ls() != "source_rmd"])
```
