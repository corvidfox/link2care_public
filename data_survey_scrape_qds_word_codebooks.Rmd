# ⭐️Overview

This file is used to scrape the Word version of the QDS codebooks. We are doing this to facilitate the process of combining all 5 individual QDS files into one. 

Just reference notes_on_qds_column_names...

Then, move all the Word scraping code here. Also, add this to R Notes. I feel like it could be useful again at some point in the future.
